    <h2 class="header">It's Pho-king delicous (Chicken Edition)</h2>

    <p>Pho is a vietnamese dish that I personally enjoy. There are different kinds of pho, but my 
        favorite flavors are beef and chicken. When the broth covers the rice noodles and layers of
        different protein on top, what's not to love? Adding in Hoisin or Sriracha sauce can make it 
        tasty too, but most the time, the base is already as good as it is.
    </p>

    <p>
        Making pho usually takes many hours to do because of how long it takes to pull the flavor from
        bones. That's right, most of the flavor within pho comes from the bones of the animal. There is, 
        however, a way to make pho in a shorter amount of time. Growing up, my mom always made a vietnamese 
        dish on her day off and everyone loved it. I may not know the exact recipe, but I can share what I 
        have seen. 
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Free range chicken</li>
        <li>Chicken boullin</li>
        <li>Thinly sliced eye round beef</li>
        <li>Soup Ga (Chicken Broth)</li>
        <li>Vien Gia Vi (Pho soup seasoning cubes, chicken)</li>
        <li>Pho Hoa (special spice for pho)</li>
        <li>Banh Pho Tuoi (pink thin rice noodles)</li>
        <li>1-2 White Onions</li>
        <li>Fish sauce</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Optional:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chopped green onion</li>
        <li>Chopped jalapeno peppers</li>
        <li>Chopped serrano peppers</li>
        <li>Mung bean sprouts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <p>This is like the beef version, just minor tweaks.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut (not all the way through) the white onion into quarters 
            and place over an open fire/roast them. This will release the 
            aroma and flavors into the soup.
        </li>
        <li>Fill a large pot a little above halfway with water and bring to a boil. Leave enough room for can of broth and beef bones.</li>
        <li>Salt the water and drop in whole chicken. Boil for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Clean the water of any residue floating at the top every 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 15 minutes, take chicken out of water and let rest. After 5-10 minutes of cooling, start taking the meat apart from the bones (try to keep intact).</li>
        <li>Once finished separating, place the bones back into the broth.</li>
        <li>Add in can of Pho Ga chicken broth.</li>
        <li>Add in one pack of Pho Hoa special spice.</li>
        <li>Add in a 1/3 cup of chicken boullin.</li>
        <li>Add 1-2 cubes of Vien Gia Vi (depending on if the broth has enough flavor).</li>
        <li>Add more fish sauce, salt, and/or boullin to the broth to meet flavor needs. Let sit at medium heat for 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>In another pot, boil some water for the rice noodles.</li>
        <li>Place rice noodles into a noodle strainer and place into the other boiling pot until all noodles sticking out are submerged.</li>
        <li>Cook for 30 seconds, constantly stirring or flipping and raising out of water and resubmerging every 5 seconds.</li>
        <li>Place cooked noodles into a bowl. Cover top with thinly sliced eye round beef and pulled (not shredded) chicken. Add green onion, sliced white onion, and jalapeno (optional).</li>
        <li>Pour hot broth over the meat to let the hot water cook.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
