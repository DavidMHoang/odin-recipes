    <h2>It's Pho-king delicous</h2>

    <p>Pho is a vietnamese dish that I personally enjoy. There are different kinds of pho, but my 
        favorite flavors are beef and chicken. When the broth covers the rice noodles and layers of
        different protein on top, what's not to love? Adding in Hoisin or Sriracha sauce can make it 
        tasty too, but most the time, the base is already as good as it is.
    </p>

    <p>
        Making pho usually takes many hours to do because of how long it takes to pull the flavor from
        bones. That's right, most of the flavor within pho comes from the bones of the animal. There is, 
        however, a way to make pho in a shorter amount of time. Growing up, my mom always made a vietnamese 
        dish on her day off and everyone loved it. I may not know the exact recipe, but I can share what I 
        have seen.
