    <h2 class="header">Spicy Beef and Pork Noodle Galor</h2>

    <p>Bun Bo Hue is one of THE best Vietnamese soups that have been created. It has a nice rich 
        broth taste to it, and some spice but nothing too spicy. It's packed full of flavor and 
        mixture of both beef and pork, alongside the aroma of lemon grass.

    <p>
        Like most broths, making it from scratch takes a good amount of patience, but it will all be 
        worth it in the end. This Bun Bo Hue recipe is one that you can make in a shorter amount of 
        time compared to the traditional method.

        <li>Add in cans of chicken broth.</li>
        <li>Add in thai chile and lemongrass.</li>
        <li>Add more fish sauce and salt to the broth to meet flavor needs. Let sit at medium heat for 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>In another pot, boil some water for the noodles.</li>
        <li>Place noodles in the boiling pot and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking and burning at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Once finished, strain the noodles and wash with cool water.</li>
